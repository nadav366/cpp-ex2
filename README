The software reads a csv file, which is sent as a parameter, and prints three types of fractals,
according to the file's instructions.

Exercise Details-
The exercise is built on one fractal class, which is a fractal and contains a string that is the
fractal pattern and the line length.
All class functions recursively create the fractal according to the given pattern.
According to this realization, which I found extremely effective and elegant, inheritance was not
necessary, but merely a preserve, for each type of fractal the appropriate pattern and size.

Programming principles-
In realization, I kept the following principles -
The Open Principle - Closed - You can add more types of fractals easily and without having to
change the main class at all.
The only principle of choice - to add more fractal types, only change one place - in the generator
that creates the objects.

The realization I chose, in my opinion, is the most changeable and expandable because everything is
built on a template - that can be added and changed very easily.
